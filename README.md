# Frontend Coding Challenge

Hello and welcome! Part of the interview process at Vangst is reviewing code you've written, seeing it run in the browser and using it as a discussion point during our in-person conversations. We want to see your approach on constructing a reusable component. At Vangst, our frontend technology stack is based in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) where we consume a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API. For this exercise, please use whatever technologies you are comfortable with that showcase your skill sets.

## Problem Statement

We need to create a reusable carousel component that cycles through any number of panels that contain the following:

1. A panel title
1. A panel description
1. A panel image

## Requirements

- Data can be hard-coded but you should anticipate it eventually coming from an outside service such as our API
- The component will be used in multiple instances with different content
- The component should support mobile and desktop layouts
- The carousel should expose at least two inputs of your choosing for pagination (i.e. timer, paddles, keyboard, touch)
- Creative assets such as typography, graphics, and images, are completely up to you
- Any additional functionality or features are welcome!

If you have any questions, please reach out to your point of contact and we'll try and get them answered as quickly as possible.

## How To Submit

We prefer to take a look at code in GitHub repositories but you can submit project files if that works better. When you're ready, please send either the links or assets through your point of contact.

## Addendum

In a real world environment we would most likely lean into installing an open source library to allow us to focus on more product specific related problems but that's not what we're looking for here. We also don't expect more than an hour or two spent completing this task. Treat this as a first draft that includes the functionality of the requirements but something that is expected to be iterated on by internal teams before we would ship this feature to production.

Also, we really want to say thank you for taking the time to work on this. We appreciate the time and energy that goes into these things.
